We meet once per week on Fridays 10-11 AM. Please join the [listserv](https://listserv.it.northwestern.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=CS-ED-READING-GROUP) for access to the Zoom link.

For each session, we start with a group summarization of the reading then go into questions and discussions. We ask that everyone comes to the reading group meeting with at least one discussion question.

If you are interested in leading a discussion on one of these papers, please reach out to the organizers.

Readings are uploaded to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SzxuHyuQLmpPPN0zQp42YKq38Y4wD_Ce?usp=share_link) for _optional_ group annotation. If you need access to the Google Drive folder, please reach out to [Melissa Chen](mailto:melissac@u.northwestern.edu).

The readings are chosen on a quarterly basis as a group based on group interest and partially referenced from [Professor Amy Ko's suggested readings](https://faculty.washington.edu/ajko/cer/#being-impactful). In the future, we expect to further explore individual interests from reading group members and read works by faculty members at Northwestern.
