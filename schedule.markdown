We meet once per week on Thursdays 2-3 PM. Please join the [listserv](https://listserv.it.northwestern.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?SUBED1=CS-ED-READING-GROUP) for access to the Zoom link.

For each session, we start with a group summarization of the reading then go into questions and discussions. We ask that everyone comes to the reading group meeting with at least one discussion question.
